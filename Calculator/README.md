# The Calculator
## Project Overview
The Calculator project is a user-friendly web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic
operations. It features a clean and morden interface, with options to switch between light and dark modes
for better user experiance and accessibility. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, 
making it a lightweight and efficient tool for everyday calculations.

## Features
Basic Arithmatic Operations: The calculator support addition, substraction, multiplecation, and division.
Clear (CLR) and Delete (DEL) function : Users can clear the entire input or delete the last character entered.
Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, 
tablets, and smartphones.
Light and Dark mode Toggle: User can switch between light and dark themes for better visibility and user comfort.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional calculator that can be used by 
anyone for basic mathematical operations. It serves as a practical example of how to build interactive web applications 
using fundamental web technologies. The project also aims to provide a function for futher enhancement and customization, allowing developers to add 
more advanced features and improve the user interface.

## Technology Used
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the calculator
CSS: Styles the calculator and handles the light and dark mode themes.
Javascript: Implements the calculator's functionality and the switch toggle eature.

## How It Works
HTML: The structure of the calculator is defined in the index.html file, which includes the display area, buttons for digits and operations,
and the toggle icins for light and dark modes.
CSS: The style.css contain the styles foe different elements, ensuring a responsive design that adapt to various screen sizes. It also 
defines the color schemes for light and dark themes.
Javascript: The script.js file contain event listeners for buttons click and theme toggles. It handle the logic for perfoming calculations,
updating the display, and switching thebween themes.

## Features Enhancement
While the current version of the calculator project provides essential features for basic arithmetic operations, there are serveral portential
 enhancement that could be implimentent in the future.

 ### Advance Calculatior Functions: 
 Adding more mathematical functions such as trigonametry, logarithms, exponents, and algebra calculations.

 ### History Log
 Implimenting a feature to keep track of previous calculations including memory functions like memory storage and recall capabilities.

 ## Conclusion
 The Calculator project is a straightforward and effective tool for basic mathematics calculations, demostrating the power of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in
 building interactive web applications. It offer a solid function for futher development and customization, making it a valuablr project for both beginners and experianced developers.
